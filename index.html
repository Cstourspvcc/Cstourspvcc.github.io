    <h2>Are We Tools of Our Tools?</h2>
    <p>In today’s world, technology is an important part of our day to day lives, giving us countless opportunities that make our goals easier and our ability to forge connections stronger. It’s important to think about the way our inventions shape our thoughts, interactions and broader society. This prompts an important question, how much do we really influence our own tools?</p>
    <p>Throughout history, humans have always relied on tools to extend our physical and intellectual capacity. In times past, the creation of stone tools and the development of language were essential, progressing us far beyond other life to become clearly intelligent. These innovations were clearly under human control and served to empower us. Technology has progressed, the relationship of creator and creation has grown in its complexity. Today’s digital age is defined by systems, such as social media platforms, search engines, and especially artificial intelligence. These technologies are so integrated into most peoples lives that they influence the way we think and how we act in ways we may not even recognize.</p>
    <p>One major example of this is found in the algorithms driving social media platforms. These algorithms are catered to capture our attention by shifting content to our personal taste and like. When you scroll through your feed, these posts and news stories you see are picked based on your past behavior, helping to create what could be called an “echo chamber.” This selective presentation of information has been found in studies to not only reinforce existing views but can also steer opinions and behaviors subtly. In this way, it seems as though our digital tools are beginning to dictate the flow of information, thus influencing our decisions and perspectives.</p>
    <p>A change in cognitive habits is another example of present technology’s subtle influence. It was typical in previous generations to memorize directions, facts, and figures. As of present, we rely on GPS systems for navigation and search engines for instant answers. The convenience can not be understated and it does come at a cost: our ability to retain information and solve problems independently. As we increasingly depend on digital devices, our mental processes are being outsourced to technology, shifting the “locus” of control. Although these tools are created to aid us, their pervasive presence in society as a whole means that the way we think and process information is gradually being shaped by them.</p>
    <p>It’s important to remember that every piece of technology is a product of a human’s creativity and intention. Regardless of whether it's a smartphone, computer program, or AI system. These tools are made with a set of specific goals in mind and to operate within boundaries set by their designers. As artificial intelligence systems become more “autonomous”, they still operate based on algorithms created by humans. This is the idea that technology, for all its sophistication, is still a direct extension of our own will and ingenuity.</p>
    <p>The tension between reliance on technology and human control forms the heart of the debate. As our digital tools become more intricate and intertwined with our lives, it is easy to see how they might start dictating behaviors. Yet, the onus remains on us to shape these tools, ensuring that they enhance rather than limit our capacities. We must remain actively engaged with technology, questioning, adapting, and refining its role in our lives, to preserve our autonomy and foster a balanced relationship.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, while it is undeniable that technology significantly influences our daily routines and cognitive habits, we are not entirely at its mercy. The tools we create do play an active role in shaping our experiences, but they remain constructs of our own design. The challenge for society is to harness these innovations in a way that amplifies our abilities without diminishing our independent thought. By maintaining critical oversight and continuing to innovate responsibly, we can ensure that our digital creations serve us, rather than inadvertently control us.</p>
